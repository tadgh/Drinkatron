The Drinkatron is a little side project that myself and a school friend are working on. 
It's essentially an automated bartender. Not much more needs to be said. Still in production, not ready for any kind of branchingâ€¦.

##Current Features:##
* Dispense a known drink(approximately 40 at the moment)
* Dispense a custom drink with user-chosen proportions
* Randomly select a drink
* temporarily modify a drink's preset ingredient values for a single dispense.
* Stores all recorded dispenses.
* Creation of new drinks.

##Coming soon:##
* Canister fluid level tracking
* Graphs and charts for dispensing information
