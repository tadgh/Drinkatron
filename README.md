The Drinkatron is a little side project that myself and a school friend are working on. 
It's essentially an automated bartender. Not much more needs to be said. 

Needs to be attached to the arduino for actual functionality, but the web server will work without it. 

You can check out a small album [here](http://imgur.com/a/Xvoca) to see what it looks like. I'll get a video of
it in action shortly enough.
